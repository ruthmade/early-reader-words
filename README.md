Reading practice for toddlers and early readers. Shows random decodable sentences with age-appropriate content.

**Live at:** [ruthmade.com/early-reader-words](https://ruthmade.com/early-reader-words)

## What it does

Displays random sentences that are:

- **Phonetically simple**: CVC words + digraphs (sh, ch, th, ck) + consonant blends (tr, st, gr, etc.)
- **Age-appropriate**: Concrete actions and concepts a 3-year-old would find familiar
- **Lowercase only**: No punctuation to distract beginning readers

## Why

My 3-year-old memorized his CVC books, so I needed fresh reading practice that:

- He can decode (no silent letters or tricky exceptions)
- He can understand (things he actually sees and does - trucks dumping rocks, getting in the van, splashing in puddles)
- Never gets stale (100+ random sentences)

## Features

- Large, clear sans-serif font
- Simple “new words” button
- Press spacebar for new sentence (easier for kids)
